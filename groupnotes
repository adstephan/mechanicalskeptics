25.5.20 AM - Group Meeting 
- Chloe taking notes
- Potential research area: the impact of political ideology on Reddit users' impressions of AI
	- What's the conceptual distance between the left and the right on AI (potentially using launch of ChatGPT for before/after) 
	- how to capture sentiment? 
- Potential issue: Reddit data is great, but it's also highly specific (but does not necessarily *appear* specific) 
	- i.e. - "users" can be anyone, might not map into left/right in American political context; Reddit users trend male, etc
	- Sadia emphasizes that we can refer to the users just as users and not pursue any further demographic information 
- Potential (related) issue: being very very careful to explictly state that this is not a general rule, but a specific set of sentiments 
from a specific set of Reddit users

- Generally in agreement that that's a good project idea; Andrew highlights a dataset he found on Academic Torrents.

- Next steps: Everyone sets up Github Desktop. Adriana makes a repository, and we get everyone on the same page for that

- Chloe taking notes 
- A mentions potential issue with dataset: version he downloaded of this data last night was incomplete, now he's having trouble downloading it in full 
- A sent S code snippets he used to download from Academic Torrent, so S will try to download it as well (to see if she can get it to work/take a look through the data)
